Installation and Setup
Setup: 
Using FUSE VERSION 29. 

Build and Compile:
Compiling mkmemefs.c - You shouldn't have to compile this, maybe because you have your own image file or you want to use mine, which is "imgfile". If you need to compile mkmemefs.c I have it in a folder called driver.
Then with memefs.c, you compile it with "make", "imgfile" as the mount point followed by a directory of your choosing. i used "mountdir".
